  { id: 1, name: "General Dentistry", description: `General dentistry covers a range of treatment options and procedures fundamental to protecting and maintaining a good standard of oral health.
 
  A routine examination is at the center of creating your personal dental plan. It allows your general dentist to clearly define what treatment is necessary for your continued oral health. 
  
  A routine examination can spot early signs of any irregularities and treat them before they progress further. This is extremely important as many oral health issues are “silent” and go unnoticed..`, image: general },
  { id: 2, name: "Composite Bonding", description: `Composite Bonding is thin layers of composite resin placed on the front surfaces of teeth to change the appearance of your smile. Teeth that are discolored, chipped, rotated, or spaced can be transformed with bonding.
  
  The teeth are generally not prepared, and tooth-colored filling material is placed on the front of the teeth, shaped to the desired form, and then finished and polished to a life-like shine. A second polishing appointment is usually necessary.`, image: bonding },
  { id: 3, name: "Invisalign", description: `Invisalign is a virtually invisible orthodontic appliance that straightens teeth as an alternative to the traditional metal ‘train track’ braces.
  
  It uses a series of clear aligners which are custom-made, barely visible, and removable.`, image: invisalign},
  { id: 4, name: "Whitening", description: `Teeth whitening is a cosmetic treatment which involves bleaching your teeth to make them whiter.
  
  The best way to keep your smile healthy and bright is to look after your teeth and gums, but it’s not unusual to need a little help.
  
  You might consider teeth whitening for different reasons. Your teeth can lose their whiteness with age but can also become stained by smoking or drinking lots of tea, coffee or red wine.`, image: whitening },
  { id: 5, name: "Crowns/ Bridges", description: `When you have a tooth that is extensively damaged or at high risk of fracture, a traditional filling might not be sufficient to support it long-term. In these situations, your general dentist might suggest a dental crown is used to restore the affected tooth.
  
  Whereas a filling will fill a hole in the tooth, a crown is designed to cover the damaged tooth, protecting it from further decay and damage.

  Crowns are also regularly used to treat chipped teeth and restore the tooth after root canal treatment. If a crown is recommended, your general dentist will prepare the tooth for the crown to be made by a dental laboratory.

  A bridge is a crown placed on a prepared tooth but with an add-on to fill the gap of a missing tooth. `, image: bridge },
  { id: 6, name: "Porcelain Veneers", description: `Porcelain is the most similar of all materials to natural enamel and hence, when done well, it can look more natural, and attractive, and resists stains better than the alternative material, composite.
  
  Porcelain veneers last 10-15 years on average but they may last short or longer than this depending on care. It is also worth noting that repair is not as easy as it is with composite.
  
  However, porcelain veneers require space to be made on the tooth to fit them and traditional porcelain veneer techniques involve drilling away small quantities of the natural tooth to create this space.
  
  Post preparation, the dentist will then make impressions of your teeth and send them off to a highly specialized lab to make you your high-quality veneers. In the meantime, you will be given temporary veneers to wear.
  Once your definitive veneers are made, they will be applied with adhesive glue to your prepared teeth for good.`, image: veneer }
